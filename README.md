But it wasnâ€™t always this way. The history of the Internet started from simple computer networks to global network connectivity and wireless communications. This website should let you familiarize with key events related to the evolution of the Internet between 1950's to 2000's.

This website also explains how the Internet works. It doesn't go into great depth, but covers enough basic understanding of the concepts involved. The various technologies that support the Internet have evolved over time, but the way it works hasn't changed that much. Internet is a way to connect computers all together and ensure that they find a way to stay connected.
